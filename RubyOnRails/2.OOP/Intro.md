## Object-Oriented Programming

### Encapsulation

- blocking areas of the code
- not making it available to the rest of the program

### Classes

- a blueprint that describes state and behavior
- a class can be used to create many objects

### Instances

- objects created at runtime from a class are called instances of that particular class

### Inheritance

- a class inherits the behavior of another class, referred to as a superclass

### Abstraction

- simplifying the complex processes of a program
- modeling classes appropriate for a program

### Polymorphism

- a class inherits one/a few behaviors of another class
- has the ability to change some of itâ€™s inherited behaviors
- a method may do something different from the inherited method
